Fire Alarm System Detection using Audio and video analysis where audio used is for Screaming datasets elsehwere the video used is of multiple fire images which will help to identify that the Fire Alarm should be triggered or not
The Dataset Link is taken from Kaggle for Audio and Image Analysis

Using the Models we can identify it further using the Algorithm to merge the Audio and Image into one personalized Algorithm which can be used in the IOT Devices to be further used for Alarm Detections. 
Also we can use the pre-trained models from Deep Learning and Computer Vision to further version of this Model. By identifying the current situation, awarness for this System and by using best possible resources  This System requires an highly scalable & powerful machines for building the Model. Also for the Hardware we will require IOT Based Sensors and Actuators to be used in the work.
